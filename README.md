Electrical Vehicle Route Finder

Web application developed with the Spring framework and Angular.

The application is meant for owners of electrical vehicles looking for where to charge their vehicles on a given route. The app calculates the best route from origin to destination and automatically selects the optimal electrical charging stations according to your vehicle electrical capacity.

I used the Google Maps library for rendering the map and calculating directions and the Open Charge Maps library to fetch existing electrical vehicles charging stations.

The application is deployed on a Heroku server and the domain is managed by GoDaddy. SSL security is managed through Cloudfare.
